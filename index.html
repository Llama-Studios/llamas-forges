<h2>Llama's Forges</h2>
  <img src="https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/8138/101/llamas-forges_1.png">
  <p>Do you ever get bored making simple tools using a few ingots and a couple of sticks? Fear not, as Llamaâ€™s Forges adds ways of melting metals, making alloys, and casting and assembling the coolest tools and armor.</p>

 <h2>Make sure you enable all experiments!</h2>
  <p>Llama's Forges allows you to mix tool/armor materials make cool gear. For example, instead of just a diamond pickaxe, you can make a diamond pickaxe with an iron rod. There are three main machines in this mod:</p>
  <h3>The Melting Basin</h3>
  <p>The melting basin is used to make molten ore.</p>
  <h4>Fueling</h4>
  <p>The melting basin requires lava as fuel. Interact (right click) on it with a lava bucket to put the lava in. After each time you use it, there is a 10% chance it will need more lava, indicated by the bar on the side.</p>
  <h4>Melting</h4>
  <p>Interact (right click) on it with an ore to melt the ore. You can also melt lava to make cobblestone. The molten ore can be removed using a bucket.</p>
  <h4>Zinc</h4>
  <p>Zinc is a new greenish-colored ore. It is used mainly to make brass, but also to craft the wrench and the template table. As a bonus, zinc nuggets can be made into white dye, as zinc is an ingredient in white paint in real life.</p>
  <h4>Alloying</h4>
  <p>The melting basin can also make alloys. If you place two ores in it that can be alloyed, they will mix. For example:<br>Gold + Debris = Netherite<br>Water + Lava = Obsidian<br>Zinc + Gold* = Brass</p>
  <p class="sm">*I know brass is really made using copper, not gold. I will change this once 1.17 comes out</p>
  <h4>Removing Machines</h4>
  <p>All the machines in this mod except the template table can be removed using the wrench. Sneak-interact (shift-right click) using the wrench to remove the machine. The template table can be broken like a normal block.</p>
  <h3>The Template Table</h3>
  <p>The template table is used to make templates, which are used to make molds. To use it, simply right click/tap it, and make the template you would like. For tool rods, there is no template, instead use a stick.</p>
  <h3>The Casting Basin</h3>
  <p>The casting basin is used to make molds, and make casts from the molds.</p>
  <h4>Making Molds</h4>
  <p>First, interact (right click) using the template you would like to create a mold for. Then, interact (right click) with either a clay block for a clay mold, or a bucket of molten brass for a brass mold. Clay molds are cheaper, but brass molds are reusable. Sneak-interact (shift-right click) on it to remove the mold.</p>
  <h4>Using Molds</h4>
  <p>First, interact (right click) using the mold to place it in the casting basin. Then, interact (right click) with a bucket of molten ore to make a cast. For example, to make a diamond pickaxe head, use a pickaxe mold and a bucket of molten diamond. Sneak-interact (shift-right click) on it to remove the mold when you are done.</p>
  <h3>The Assembly Table</h3>
  <p>The assembly table is used to put together the tool/armor parts that you get from the casting basin. First, sneak-interact (shift-right click) on it until the type of tool/armor you would like to make is displayed on top. Then, interact (right click) on it, and select the tool/armor you want.</p>
  <h4>Armor Benefits:</h4>
  <p>Iron - Thorns 2<br>Gold - Protection 3<br>Diamond - Protection 4<br>Netherite - Unbreaking 3</p>
  <h4>Tool Benefits:</h4>
  <p>Iron - Unbreaking 2<br>Gold - Efficiency 4<br>Diamond - Fortune 3<br>Netherite - Unbreaking 3</p>
  <h4>Weapon Benefits:</h4>
  <p>Iron - Sharpness 3<br>Gold - Fire Aspect 2<br>Diamond - Looting 3<br>Netherite - Unbreaking 3</p>
  <p>If the limit of levels is reached on an enchantment, the additional levels are ignored. For example, an iron-iron pickaxe gets unbreaking 3, not unbreaking 4. Axes are considered both a tool and a weapon, so they get both tool and weapon benefits.</p>
  <h4>Synergy</h4>
  <p>There is also a benefit to making tools/armor with two part of the same material: Synergy. Any tool or armor that is made up of two pieces of the same material gets the ability to mend itself with experience points. This also applies to netherite-gold tools/armor, as netherite is an alloy containing gold.</p>
